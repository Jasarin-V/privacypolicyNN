Welcome to the Perfumania Holdings web site (http://www.perfumaniaholdings.com), which is owned and operated by Perfumania Holdings, Inc. (collectively, “Perfumania,” “we,” “our,” or “us”).  This “Privacy Policy” governs your use of the Perfumania Holdings site as well as any other web site that posts a link to this Privacy Policy(including both mobile and online versions) features, widgets, applications, content or downloads that: (i) we own or control; (ii) we make available through a site; or (iii) interact with a site and post this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Site”), regardless of how you access or use the Site, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to our data collection activities offline or otherwise outside of our Site (unless otherwise stated below).

In addition, please review the Site’s Terms of Use, which governs your use of the Site.  By using our Site, you consent to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.

 

1.         What Information Does the Site Collect?

(a)               Information You Provide To Us

Personal Information and Demographic Information.  On the Site, we may ask you to provide certain categories of information such as: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you personally, such as your first and last name, email address, home address and phone number (“Personal Information”); and (2) demographic information, such as information about your gender (“Demographic Information”).  We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Site, including, through “contact us” forms, when you sign up for notifications from us, or when you otherwise interact with the Site.  If we combine Demographic Information with the Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Site, we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.

(b)        Information We Collect and Store As You Access and Use the Site

In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Site, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) store or collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Site (“Usage Information”).  This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, laptop, tablet or mobile phone (a “Device”) whenever you visit or interact with our Site.  Usage Information may be non‑identifying or may be associated with you.  Whenever we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information.  This Usage Information may include:

your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”).  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Site, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;
your Device functionality (including browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);
the URL that referred you to our Site;
the areas within our Site that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences;
your Device location;
your Device characteristics; and
certain other Device data, including the time of day, among other information.
We may use various developed methods and technologies to store or collect Usage Information (“Tracking Technologies”).  Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device.  A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):

Cookies.  A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Site.  A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device.  HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage.  Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in.  Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings.  Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard.  Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies.  For information on disabling Flash cookies go to Adobe’s web site www.adobe.com.  Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies, Flash cookies, or HTML5 cookies on your Device, some parts of our Site may not function properly, and that when you revisit our Site your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.

Embedded Scripts.  An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:

Strictly Necessary.  We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that we consider are strictly necessary to allow you to use and access our Site, including cookies required to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of Site functionality.

Performance‑Related.  We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are useful in order to assess the performance of the Site, including as part of our analytic practices or otherwise to improve the content, products or services offered through the Site.

Functionality‑Related.  We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are required to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing the Site.

Targeting‑Related.  We may use Tracking Technologies to deliver content relevant to your interests on our Site and third‑party sites based on how you interact with our content. 

There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Service. 

2.         How Do We Use the Information Collected?

We may use your Personal Information, Demographic Information or Usage Information for various purposes, including:

to send you electronic newsletters or to provide you with special offers or promotional and marketing materials on behalf of us or third parties, including to let you know about new products, services or upcoming events;
to improve the Site, marketing endeavors or our service offerings;
to customize your experience on the Site or to serve you specific content or ads that are relevant to you;

for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. 
3.         How and When Do We Disclose Information to Third Parties?

We do not share Personal or Non-Personal Information with third parties, unless:

 (a)       Administrative and Legal Reasons.  We may access, use, preserve, transfer and disclose your information (including Device Identifiers and Personal Information) to third parties: (i) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoenas, governmental requests or legal process if in our good faith opinion such is required or permitted by law; (ii) to protect and/or defend the Site’s Terms of Use[LINK] or other policies applicable to the Site, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (iii) to protect the safety, rights, property or security of the Site or any third party; and/or (iv) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.  Further, we may use IP address or other Device Identifiers, to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with third parties such as copyright owners, internet service providers, wireless service providers and/or law enforcement agencies, including disclosing such information to third parties, all in our discretion, subject to applicable law.  Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.

(b)        Affiliates and Business Transfer.  We may share your information, including your Device Identifiers and Personal Information, Demographic Information and Usage Information with our parent, subsidiaries and affiliates.

4.         What About Information I Disclose Publicly?

(a)        User-Generated Content and Public Information.The Site may permit you to submit various types of content (collectively, “User Content”).  We or others may store, display, reproduce, publish, distribute or otherwise use User Content online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or hereafter developed) and may or may not attribute it to you.  Others may have access to this User Content and may have the ability to share it with third parties.  Please think carefully before deciding what information you share in connection with your User Content.  Please note that the Company does not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure.  Our promises under this Privacy Policy do not apply to any information that you disclose publicly, share with others or otherwise upload onto the publicly available positions of our Site.  We are not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any User Content that you disclose or receive from third parties through the Site. 

5.         Do Third-Party Content, Links to Third-Party Sites and/or Third-Party Apps Appear on the Site?

The Site may contain content that is supplied by a third party, and those third parties may collect Usage Information and your Device Identifier when pages from the Site are served to you.  In addition, when you are on the Site you may be directed to other services that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control.  We are not responsible for the data collection and privacy practices employed by any of these third parties or their services and they may be tracking you across multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or others.  For example, if you “click” on a link, the “click” may take you off the Site onto a different site.  These other sites may associate their Tracking Technologies with you, independently collect data about you, including Personal Information, and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. 

6.         How Do I Change My Information and Communications Preferences?

You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us. The Site may allow you to review, correct or update Personal Information you have provided through the Site’s forms or otherwise, and you may provide updates and changes by contacting us atinfo@parlux.com. We will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable.  Please note that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases and that residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons.  Also, if you have made any public postings on the Site such as in forums or blogs, these communications cannot generally be removed.  When you edit your Personal Information or change your preferences on the Site, information that you remove may persist internally for our administrative purposes.  You may cancel or modify our email marketing communications you receive from us by following the instructions contained within our promotional emails. This will not affect subsequent subscriptions and if your opt-out is limited to certain types of emails the opt-out will be so limited.
