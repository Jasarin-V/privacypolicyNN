We may, from time to time, share Personal Information and other information with other companies who may provide you information about the products and services they offer.
We may analyze your Personal Information and other information in aggregate form which does not identify you personally.

Controlling Your Communication Preferences
Our Sites provide users with the opportunity to control what communications they receive from us. You can go to the Progress Preference Center at any time to change your communication preferences, including unsubscribing to the various communication offerings at any time.

Third Party Payment Processor
We use third-party service providers (“Payment Processors”) to manage credit card processing. Under our agreement with service providers, they are not permitted to store, retain, or use your Personal Information or your billing information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf. In certain cases, we may have access to the last four digits of your credit card number, its expiration date, and the billing address, which we will use solely to assist us in providing the product or service you purchased. In addition, we and our service providers may use any information processed pursuant to this section at an aggregate level for internal business analyses and fraud prevention.

Communications on the Sites
Any Personal Information or other content that you choose to submit in any forum on the Sites may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the Personal Information or other content that you choose to submit in these forums.

Any content or Personal Information you publish on the Sites may also appear in search engine results (such as Google, Yahoo!, and Bing), in the cache of those search engines, in feeds, and on third-party sites pursuant to cobranding agreements. We have no control over updating and/or removal of such content or Personal Information, which is the sole responsibility of the search engines, third-party sites, and RSS web feed resources. You agree and acknowledge that we are not liable for the information published in search results or by any third-party site that carries any content or Personal Information you publish on the Sites. We strongly discourage your posting any content or Personal Information that you do not want others to see or use.

We do not and cannot review all communications and materials posted to or created by users that visit the Sites or use the Services. However, we reserve the right to block or remove communications, content, Personal Information, or other submissions to the Sites, for any reason, in our sole and absolute discretion.

Our Security Practices
Progress employs industry standard security measures to ensure the security of information. However, the security of information transmitted through the Internet can never be guaranteed. Progress is not responsible for any interception or interruption of any communications through the internet or for changes to or losses of information. Users of our sites are responsible for maintaining the security of any password, user ID, or other form of authentication involved in obtaining access to password protected or secure areas of any of our websites. To protect you and your information, Progress may suspend your use of a website, without notice, pending an investigation, if any breach of security is suspected. Access to and use of password protected and/or secure area of any Progress Software site is restricted to authorized users only. Unauthorized access to such areas is prohibited and may lead to criminal prosecution.

We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures designed to help prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data security, and to use correctly the Information we collect online. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect and store. We also use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.

Service Providers
We use third-parties to assist us providing you with a variety of services while using the Progress Properties. When you subscribe to receive any of these services, we will share your Personal Information only as necessary with the third-party solely for the purpose of providing that service. In addition, we may use specialized third-parties for our subscription billing platform.

These companies may use your information to help Progress Software communicate with you about offers from Progress Software and our partners. These companies do not have any independent right to share this information. We will obtain your initial consent prior to sharing your personal information. If you would like to opt out of having your information shared with these third parties in the future, you may Contact Us, but please note that opting out may preclude you from licensing certain products due to our point of sale processes.

Commitment to Children’s Online Privacy
Progress Software Websites are not directed at children. Progress Software does not knowingly accept online Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If you are under 18 or otherwise would be required to have parent or guardian consent to share information with Progress Software, you should not share any information about yourself.

Cross Border Transfers of Your Personal information
We are a corporation with operations worldwide, and have developed global data practices designed to assure your Personal Information is appropriately protected. Please note that your Personal Information may be transferred, accessed and stored globally as necessary for the uses stated above in accordance with this policy.

Because Progress Software is headquartered in the United States, we may have a need to transfer information collected from our non-U.S. customers to the U.S. We may also have a need to transfer our customer information (regardless of where you live) to other countries or places in which we or our agents/contractors maintain offices or facilities.

Progress complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data provided to Progress by its customers and business partners where such data are transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. For purposes of enforcing compliance with the Privacy Shield, Progress is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission. Progress has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles (the “Principles”). To read our Privacy Shield Statement click here. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/list.

Progress commits to cooperate with any applicable EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) and to comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to human resources data transferred from the EU and Switzerland in the context of the employment relationship.

Consistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, Progress may transfer personal information to third parties, including transfers from one country to another. We will only disclose an individual’s non-public personal information to third parties either (a) to a third party providing services to Progress, or to the individual, in connection with the operation of our business, and as consistent with the purpose for which the personal information was collected, (b) with the data subject’s permission, (c) where required to meet a legal obligation, or (d) where reasonably necessary for compliance, regulatory or other legal purposes. Progress maintains written contracts with applicable third-parties to ensure that they provide at least the same level of privacy protection and security as required by the Privacy Shield Principles. To the extent provided by the Principles, Progress remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if a third-party that it engages to process personal information on its behalf does so in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless Progress proves that it is not responsible for the matter giving rise to the damage.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Progress commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Progress at Privacy@Progress.com. Emails to this address are received and reviewed by Progress’ Data Protection Officer.

Progress has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.

If your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel.

Correcting and Updating Your Personal Information
Progress may retain your information for a period of time consistent with the original purpose of collection. For instance, we may retain your information during the time in which you have an account to use our Sites or Services and for a reasonable period of time afterward. We also may retain your information during the period of time needed for Progress to pursue our legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.

You may request to review, correct, delete or otherwise modify any of the personal information that you have previously provided to us through the Progress Properties. If you have registered for an account with Progress, you may generally update your user settings, profile, organization’s settings or event registration by logging into the applicable Site or Service with your username and password and editing your settings or profile. To update your billing information, discontinue your account, and/or request return or deletion of your Personal Information associated with your account, please contact your account representative or the customer service team for the applicable Service. For other requests to access, correct, modify or delete your Personal Information, please review the “Contact Us” section below. Requests to access, change, or delete your information will be addressed within a reasonable timeframe. If you are an employee of a Progress customer, you may also wish to contact your company’s system administrator for assistance in correcting or updating your information.

Changes to Policy
Progress will occasionally update this Policy. When we do, we will post a prominent notice in this section of this policy notifying users when it is updated. For material changes (i.e., substantially new practices you wouldn’t expect from us or that we didn’t previously tell you about), we may decide to give you notice via email, in which case you will have a choice as to whether or not we use your Personal Information in this different manner. We reserve the right to make changes to our practices and this Policy at any time, provided that we follow the procedures above.

If Progress goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal information collected through our website(s) may be among the assets transferred. A prominent notice will appear on our website(s) for 30 days after any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

This Policy revises and supersedes the previous versions dated May 3, 2016, March 16, 2016, August 1, 2014 and November 15, 2011. This Policy also replaces the DataRPM, Kinvey and Telerik privacy policies.
