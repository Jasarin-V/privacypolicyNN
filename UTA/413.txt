Information We Collect and Its Uses
Creating an Account Profile
Owners of our products and programs may, at their choice, create a personal account profile online within our password- protected sites. Creating an account profile makes use of our sites more convenient for you by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter personal contact or preference information. In addition, if you choose, you can perform certain functions within your account, such as making online club dues or maintenance fee payments. The security of this information is addressed in the security section below. You can access and review, update or deactivate the information in your account profile online.

Please note that we will never send you an email requesting your user name, password, credit card, social security or national insurance numbers. If you receive an email that looks like it is from us, but asks you for your credit card number, social security or national insurance number, it is a fraudulent email or "phish."

If you believe "phishers" have obtained access to your personal or financial information, we recommend that you change your password and contact credit reporting services and have a fraud alert attached to your credit report file. Please be aware that the perpetrator may attempt to use your information to establish accounts or obtain credit at other businesses in their name or yours. We will not be able to secure your information and we will not be liable for any resulting breach of any law if you reveal your password to anyone.

Security of Information
We treat the personal information you provide to us as confidential; it is, accordingly, subject to our organizational, physical, and technical security measures, procedures, and policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. After information reaches us, it is stored on a secure server that resides behind firewalls designed to block unauthorized access. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, additional measures that satisfy applicable legal requirements may be put in place.

When we ask you for credit card information, it is transferred using secure transmission protocols. We also use secure transmission protocols on other select pages where you would enter personal information. This ensures that your information is encrypted as it travels over the Internet. This secure mode is enabled before any such information is transmitted from your computer. You will know you are in secure mode when the padlock or key icon in the lower right-hand or left-hand corner of the computer screen appears in the locked position. In addition, when accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." There is no guarantee, however, that the transmission, Internet, or storage system is fully secure. Please immediately notify us using the contact methods contained in the Introduction section of this Statement if you have reason to believe that your interaction with us has been compromised.

Confidentiality of Identification Numbers
When collected, Social Security, National Insurance and other government-issued identification numbers are treated with great care, including our satisfaction of applicable laws and regulations. Social Security, National Insurance and other government-issued identification numbers are collected and retained in order to comply with various United States Federal and State laws and International regulations. For general information systems, we use customer numbers and employee identification numbers that are not derived from government-issued identification numbers. We use policies, procedures, training, technology and auditing to protect the confidentiality and privacy of Social Security, National Insurance other government-issued identification numbers and ensure that proper controls are in place concerning the collection, use, disclosure, processing, recording, holding, storing, and/or sharing of this information.
