Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. (“A&B”) strongly believes in protecting the privacy of visitors to its web site. This Privacy Policy serves to inform you what information is collected when you visit the web site and how that information is used.

A&B’s web server recognizes the domain names of visitors to its web site, but not visitors’ e-mail addresses or other personally identifying information. The domain name information may be aggregated to gauge the use of the site (i.e., the number of “hits” on a specific web page) and to improve the content of the site.

The information you provide on-line (e.g., pursuant to the Information Request Form) will be used only for the specific purpose for which that information was submitted, and then destroyed. Any names, telephone numbers, and postal and e-mail addresses you provide will NOT be compiled into any type of mailing list, used for any type of e-mail solicitation, or otherwise shared with any other party, unless required by law through subpoena or other legal process.

A&B currently does not use cookies on its web site, but may decide to use them in the future. Cookies are pieces of information that some web sites transfer to a computer that is visiting that web site in order to make visiting the site easier, such as by saving certain information (e.g., your password) which you provided earlier.

A&B reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any modifications will be reflected promptly on this page. If you have any questions concerning this Privacy Policy, please e-mail your question to us at invrel@abinc.com with the phrase “Privacy Policy” in the subject field.
