What information does CMS Energy gather about me and how is it used?
CMS Energy gathers general information from all guests who visit our web site, and requests specific information from others. Whenever information is requested, the guest may decide not to provide it.

When you come to our web site, we gather statistical information such as your Internet Provider and pages visited within our web site. This is used to help us continually improve our web site and compile broad demographic information.

In a few areas of our web site we request specific information from our guests. Basically, we only ask for information we need, when we need it. In most cases you can decline to provide the information. In these cases, if you decide not to provide the information, or provide incorrect information, you will not be able to take full advantage of the services offered. Sensitive information is handled in a secure manner (See Security Statement for more details).

Guest's role in maintaining privacy
As noted in our Security Statement, CMS Energy has taken measures to protect sensitive information that is shared with us. Guests also play an important role in maintaining privacy. Learn how to check the security level of your browser before sending sensitive information. If your browser is not secure, don't send it. When selecting a password choose one that's easy for you to remember, but difficult for others to guess. The CMS Energy Security Statement identifies how to check browser security and offers password tips.

What are “cookies” and does CMS Energy use them?
A cookie is a piece of information that a web server may place on a guest's computer hard drive when the guest visits their web site. Typically the cookie information is accessed by the web server whenever the guest visits their web site. This lets the server know that this guest has been to the web site before. The specific contents of a cookie are determined by the web owner. Guests may set their browsers to notify them before accepting or rejecting a cookie. If you have set your browser to reject cookies you may still use our web site.

CMS Energy does use cookies, however, in non-intrusive ways. We do not store any personally identifiable information in your cookie and we do not use cookies in any manner that would infringe on the anonymity of persons accessing our web site. CMS Energy only uses cookies to enhance and optimize our guest’s experience while visiting our web site. CMS Energy does not use cookies to retrieve any information from our guest’s computer.

What is CMS Energy's policy regarding email?
If you are using online transactional services, such as our online job application feature, you may receive emails from us (or a third party acting on our behalf) related to your online transactions. You may receive emails from us (or a third party acting on our behalf) containing information we think you may find helpful or interesting (“Informational emails”). If required by law, you will be given the option to “opt out of” receiving future Informational emails.

We do not ask for personal or account information in an email unless you have contacted us first and we need to clarify your request. Be sure any links embedded in the email are actually taking you to a CMS Energy web site. If you have any doubt an email is really from us, go to our web site directly by typing consumersenergy.com into your browser window and navigating to the desired page.
