 9. International Transfer of Personal Data
We are an international business and, at times, will need to transfer your Personal Data within the Catalent group, and to third parties as noted in Section 7 above, in connection with the purposes set out in this Policy. In particular, if this involves transferring your Personal Data from inside to outside the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), we will take steps to ensure your information remains adequately protected in accordance with this Policy and applicable law, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
The destination of a transfer for your Personal Data may be to the United Kingdom, the EEA, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, Singapore, Switzerland, the United States, Uruguay, or any future location where Catalent may operate a facility (which locations are available on http://www.catalent.com). These locations may have different laws and data protection compliance requirements, including data protection laws of a lower standard than those that apply in the country in which you are located. However, if we make such a transfer of your Personal Data, we will take steps to ensure that the privacy of your Personal Data is respected, by ensuring that one of the following safeguards is put in place:
• Our intercompany data transfer agreement for transfers between entities in the Catalent group;
• Appropriate contractual clauses; or
• Other valid transfer mechanisms.

Effective Date: May 25, 2018 Page 7
 
We store all of our data, including Personal Data, in secure environments. We provide training to our employees on data protection best practices and require them to enter into confidentiality agreements with us.

You are responsible for ensuring that items of Personal Data that you send to us are sent securely.

We will seek to Process such Personal Data only with parental consent.
We do not knowingly seek or intend to Process Personal Data from children on our websites. Children are not permitted to use the Catalent websites or services, and we request that children not submit any Personal Data through our websites.
Parents or legal guardians who believe that a child has submitted personal information to us and would like to have it deleted may contact us at privacy@catalent.com.
12.Data Retention
Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or regulation, Catalent will only retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, as required to satisfy any legal, accounting, or reporting obligations, or as necessary to resolve any dispute or enforce any legal right. To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider our statutory obligations, the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the reasons why we Process your Personal Data, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.
Once the retention period expires, Personal Data that is no longer needed is either irreversibly anonymized (and the anonymized information will be retained) or securely destroyed.
