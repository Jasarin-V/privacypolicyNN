4. Polling
Akorn may offer interactive polls to website visitors so they can easily share their opinions with other website visitors and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are collected and are not identifiable to any particular website visitor. Akorn may use a system to "tag" website visitors after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual website visitors and is delivered in the form of a cookie.


5. Surveys
Akorn may occasionally send user surveys to improve and optimize content delivered to our website visitors. We sometimes share the collected demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any another company or individual.


Usage tracking
Akorn tracks user traffic patterns throughout the Akorn website and all of our microsites. We do not correlate this information with data about individual website visitors. Akorn does analyze overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every website visitor's browser).


Akorn sometimes tracks and stores the search terms website visitors enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual website visitors. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites website visitors like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual website visitors read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continuously make improvements for you.


Cookies
Akorn may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain personal information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. Each cookie has a determined expiration date and will automatically remove itself from the browser files. The only personal information a cookie contains is the information you provide voluntarily. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites. Akorn uses cookies to track website users (as described above) and as a functionality to improve the shopping experience at Akorn Direct.

Use of Information

We use information that website visitors voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters, product updates and confirmation triggered from an action made on the website. Akorn also gives website visitors the opportunity to participate in polls, forms, surveys, message boards, and forums. We send out newsletters and product updates to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the program), and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. Akorn never shares mailing lists with other companies and individuals, including advertisers, sponsors or partners.


When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites website visitors like and don't like based on traffic to those areas.

Akorn creates reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our website visitors to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because we do not track the usage patterns of individual website visitors, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our website visitors or the public.
