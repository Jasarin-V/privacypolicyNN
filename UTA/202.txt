COOKIES
The Site, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use "cookies" and other technologies to help visitors and users move faster throughout the Site. When a visitor or user accesses the Site and takes advantage of certain features, we place several cookies on that user's computer. A cookie is a string of information sent by a Site and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory. This allows the Site to recognize you as you move through the Site. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.

It may be necessary - by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence - for Casey's to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.
